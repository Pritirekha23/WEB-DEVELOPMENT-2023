<blockquote>
In HTML, the <blockquote> element is used to indicate a section of quoted text from another source. It is typically used to distinguish quoted text from the surrounding text and to provide visual emphasis to the quoted text.

When using the <blockquote> element, the quoted text should be indented or formatted in a way that clearly distinguishes it from the surrounding text. The <blockquote> element can also be used in conjunction with the <cite> element to provide attribution to the source of the quoted text.

Here's an example of how to use the <blockquote> element in HTML:

<blockquote>
    "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
</blockquote>
<cite>-Alan Kay</cite>
In this example, the text "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." is quoted using the <blockquote> element, and the source of the quote, Alan Kay, is attributed using the <cite> element.
